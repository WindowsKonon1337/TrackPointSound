# TrackPoint Sound

## Description
This project is a more serious implementation of a comic program for playing sound when touching a trackpoint
## dependencies
* sfml
  
  Ubuntu
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libsfml-dev libudev-dev 
  ```
  
  Arch-based
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S sfml
  ```

## possible problems
1. For Ubuntu 22.04 and below, the apt repository contains a version of sfml that does not support mp3 playback. It is recommended that when adding your audio, use a supported format, or manually compile a more recent version of the library
